    <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Tolar</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Date you publish the policy, e.g., December 26, 2025]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>AI Tolar</strong> ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>[Your Name or Company Name]</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal identification to use our app.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

    <p>We collect a minimal amount of information to provide and improve our service:</p>

    <p><strong>a) Conversation Data</strong><br>
    The questions you ask and the conversations you have within the App are processed to provide you with the AI's response.</p>
    
    <p><em>[CRITICAL: CHOOSE AND EDIT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS AND REMOVE THE OTHER]</em></p>
    
    <!-- Option A -->
    <p><strong>Option A (If you send data to a third-party like OpenAI):</strong> To provide the AI service, your conversations are sent to a third-party AI provider, <strong>[CRITICAL: NAME THE AI SERVICE YOU USE, E.G., OPENAI, GOOGLE GEMINI]</strong>. We do not store your conversations on our servers. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of <strong>[NAME THE AI SERVICE AGAIN]</strong> to understand how they handle your data.</p>
    
    <!-- Option B -->
    <p><strong>Option B (If all AI processing is on-device):</strong> All AI processing, including your conversations, happens entirely on your device. Your conversation data never leaves your device and is not seen by us or any third party.</p>


    <p><strong>b) In-App Subscription Data</strong><br>
    We use Apple's StoreKit framework for in-app subscriptions. We do not collect or have access to your payment information, such as credit card numbers. Apple processes all payments. We only receive verification from Apple that you have a valid subscription, which allows us to grant you unlimited access.</p>

    <p><strong>c) Free Trial Status (Keychain Data)</strong><br>
    To provide a one-time free use of our service, we store a simple "true/false" flag in your device's secure Keychain. This data is stored only on your device, is not linked to you personally, and is used solely to prevent abuse of the free trial feature.</p>

    <p><strong>d) Anonymous Usage Data (Analytics)</strong><br>
    We may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how you use the App. This may include information like your device type, operating system version, and feature usage patterns. This data is not linked to you personally and is used only to help us improve the app's performance and user experience. We do not use third-party analytics services that track you across apps.</p>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To process your questions and deliver AI responses.</li>
        <li><strong>To Manage Your Subscription:</strong> To verify your subscription status and unlock premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve Our App:</strong> To understand usage patterns and make our app better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except as described in this policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Service Provider:</strong> As mentioned above, conversation data may be shared with our AI service provider <strong>[If using Option A, NAME THE AI SERVICE AGAIN]</strong> to fulfill your requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>

    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we handle. The one-time free trial flag is stored in the secure Keychain on your device. All communication with our AI service provider is encrypted.</p>

    <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>Our service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
